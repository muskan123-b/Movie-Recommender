# Recommendation System
Recommendation System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the userâ€™s choices. Recommendation systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. Netflix, Amazon, and other companies use recommendation systems to help their users find the right product or movie for them.

There are mainly 2 types of recommendation systems:
1. **Content-based Filtering:** These suggest recommendations based on the item metadata (movie, product, song, etc). Here, the main idea is if a user likes an item, then the user will also like items similar to it.
2. **Collaboration-based Filtering:** These systems make recommendations by grouping the users with similar interests. For this system, metadata of the item is not required.

**In this project, we are building a Content-based recommendation engine for movies.**
